# Security Audit Report

## 1. Dependency vulnerability scan
- The repository includes `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
- Run `npm audit` regularly to scan for vulnerable dependencies.
- Update and commit lockfiles (e.g., via `npm audit fix` or `npm update`) as part of routine security maintenance.

## 2. Static code analysis
- Attempted to install and run `eslint` with security rules, but npm registry access was denied (`403 Forbidden`).
- Recommend integrating a security-focused linter (e.g., ESLint with `eslint-plugin-security`) in CI once network access permits.

## 3. Configuration & secrets check
- **CSP**: `index.html` sets a restrictive Content-Security-Policy allowing scripts from `'self'`, `https://apis.google.com`, and `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net`.
- **Service worker**: `sw.js` precaches assets and updates caches on activation. No explicit `Cache-Control` headers are added by the simple dev server; ensure production responses set appropriate headers for sensitive data.
- **Secrets**: Repository scan found only placeholder values (e.g., `YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY`). No credentials committed.

## 4. Runtime behavior verification
- Local test server (`python -m http.server`) served assets without `Cache-Control` headers.
- `encryptForShare` / `decryptShared` functions successfully roundâ€‘trip data in Node.js, demonstrating encryption and passcode flows.
- Full browser-based verification of service worker behavior and passcode UI was not performed.

## 5. Summary & recommendations
- Establish dependency management and run regular `npm audit` scans.
- Add automated static security analysis to CI once network access allows dependency installation.
- Configure production server or service worker to enforce strict `Cache-Control` headers on sensitive endpoints.
- Continue to avoid committing real credentials; use environment variables and templates for secrets.

## 6. Staging environment review
- `npm test` confirmed the service worker injects `Cache-Control: no-store` for `/config.json` requests.
- Encryption helpers (`encryptForShare`/`decryptShared`) successfully round-trip data in Node, validating passcode-derived AES-256-GCM behavior.
- Browser DevTools verification of passcode flows and HTTP headers was not executed in this environment; staging deployments should still be manually inspected.
